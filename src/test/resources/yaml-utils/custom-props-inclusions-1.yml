# Custom variables are local to each file, the variables that a file
# sees are the one coming from the parents plus those defined here.
# The root file gets environment and Java properties
"@properties":
  # These have local scope only
  descr: "Description from the included file"
  # This is the value that is seen hereby when used, top-level has defined it with 2.0 and 
  # that is the value used on that level
  appVersion: 1.0
  # This has local scope too. Top level is using localVar, but it can't see this local value
  localVar: "Local value"

# This resolves to "The Nice App: Description from the included file. Default version: 1.0"
# That's because
#  1) the @properties scopes spans top-down, while 'descr' has a local definition
#  2) the 2.0 value for appVersion that comes from the top gets the local-scope value of 1.0. 
#  3) this field belong to the top-level JSON object and that is merged into the including file's top-level object.
description: "${appName}: ${descr}. Default version: ${appVersion}"
