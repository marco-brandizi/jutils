## 11.0
* **Big refactoring**: previous split into multiple jutils-xxx modules removed, 
  now there is only one Maven project, with optional dependencies (see the [POM](pom.xml)).
* `YAMLLoader` added, to manage configurations. 
* `ConfigBootstrapWebListener` added.
* More exceptions added to `uk.ac.ebi.utils.opt.net.exceptions`
* `ExceptionUtils`, methods like `<build|throw>Ex()` are able to accept `$cause` in the message template.
* `ExceptionLogger` added.

* `RegEx`, pattern-based cached instances added for efficiency.

*If not otherwise specified, items refer to the base module (`jutils`)*.


## 10.0
* **FROM NOW ON, JDK < 11 IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED**. jutils will possibly work with 1.8 for a
  while (until we start introducing incompatible changes), but that's not officially 
  supported.
* **Repository moved to a [new place](https://github.com/marco-brandizi/jutils)**.
* Class-based thread names in `uk.ac.ebi.utils.threading.batchproc.BatchProcessor`.
